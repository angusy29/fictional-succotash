# fictional-succotash

A fictional fantasy RPG. 

You begin as a rogue warrior named Gash, on a mission to cleanse the land of evil.

Created with Unity Engine.

## Disclaimer

I'm a noob game developer so everything is really messy.
Honestly not even sure if my classes/objects are set up correctly.
The game itself feels out of proportion (character too large, enemies too small, structures too small).

## Gameplay

### Movement
W - Move forwards  
A - Strafe left  
S - Strafe right  
D - Move backwards  
Shift - Run

### Combat
Left click - Swing sword  
Z - Hide sword  

Health bar decreases when hit.

Stamina drains when running or attacking.  
Player cannot run or attack when the stamina completely depletes, until it replenishes back to full.  
Stamina will replenish when player is out of combat at a fairly quick pace.
